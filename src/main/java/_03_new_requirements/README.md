New requirements:

- Any time the count is a multiple of 24, instead of printing "n bottles of pop", print "n/24 two-fours of pop".
- Any time the count is a multiple of 6, instead of printing "n bottles of pop", print "n/6 six-packs of pop".
- Still take into acount plurality (e.g. 1 two-four vs 3 two-fours)
